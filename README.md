## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### 📦 Containers
I have implemented several core data structures from scratch to understand their internal memory management:
* **Vector & SingleLinkedList**: Manual memory management and node linking.
* **HashTable**: Implementation of hashing functions and collision handling.
* **Tree & Set**: Hierarchical data structures and search logic.
* **Stack & Queue**: LIFO and FIFO implementations using underlying containers.

### 🔍 Algorithms
A deep dive into sorting efficiency and functional programming:
* **Sorting**: Comparison of `BubbleSort` ($O(n^2)$), `MergeSort` ($O(n \log n)$), and `QuickSort`.
* **Functional**: `ForEach` implementation to demonstrate passing functions as arguments.

### 🔗 Iterators
* Custom iterator logic to provide a unified interface for traversing both linear (Vector) and non-linear (Tree) structures.
